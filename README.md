This is an application for analyzing information in digimon games. Currently cyber sleuth is the only supported game.

## Information 

Interesting details I learned from this project were that.
1. Megas are the most populated stage of digimon evolution, followed by champions and ultimates.
2. Virus digimon are the most promiment in the game with them totaling around 112, vaccine and data following them with 97 and 81 total digimon respectively.
3. The distance between nodes is fairly uniform
4. Champion and Ultimate digimon are central to the graph.
